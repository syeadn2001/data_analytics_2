# Data Analytics Class for CUNY EverUP Microcredential 

This was a class I took in Summer of 2021. It was a 100 hour course condensed that ran from July-August. I learned many technologies related to Data Analytics and Data Science, which all culminated into a final project where we analyzed a diabetic patient data and created multiple models to predict whether a patient would have diabetes or not.
